# Recipes

These are recipes for bevy game engine.

I just made them for fun and for learning, so I will not assure the codes work properly.

## How to run

First, search for the recipe path you want to run in `Cargo.toml` file.

And replace the name of the recipe in the following commands.

```sh
cargo run --bin recipe_name
```

example: running `hello_world`

```sh
cargo run --bin hello_world
```
